# MIDIProgramSplitter
Program to split tracks with multiple instruments

TODO: Write a readme

Basically you can split a midi with program changes into a new midi that has one track per instrument, while keeping the events on all the new tracks.

Useful if you want to remix.

Also now you can export directly to a .flp file and it's basically a way better MIDI importer than FL Studio has by default.

The video doesn't show the automation clips at the bottom, and pitches are still broken in the FLP.
